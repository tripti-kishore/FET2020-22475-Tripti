        <h2>THE BOOK <br></h2>
        A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images,
        typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) 
        bound together and pro
        tected by a cover.The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex 
        (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written 
        compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. 
        A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
